1
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,956
Everybody, heads
up! Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,411
Keep it clear!

3
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,335
Stand back!

4
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,338
Bring it forward, come on!

5
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,682
Slow it down!

6
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,531
Pushing team, move
in there. Move in.

7
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,954
On your ready. I want
Tasers on full charge.

8
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,454
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

9
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,376
Ready. Move it.

10
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,045
And push.

11
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,464
Locked. Loading team, step away.

12
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,806
Move it.

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,437
Jophery, raise the gate.

14
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,790
Block the opening!
Don't let her get out!

15
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,589
Somebody help him!

16
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,682
Work her back!

17
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,520
Shoot her!

18
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,387
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

19
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:59,416
What's this I hear at the airport,
Hammond's not even here.

20
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:00,785
He sends his apologies.

21
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,799
We are facing a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker

22
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:06,098
and you're telling me that
Hammond can't see me?

23
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,447
He had to leave early, he wants to be
with his daughter, she's getting a divorce.

24
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:12,634
I understand that, but we've been
advised to deal with the situation now.

25
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,008
-The insurance company...
-You okay?

26
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:19,688
The underwriters feel that
the accident has raised some

27
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:22,057
very serious safety
questions about the park.

28
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,545
That makes the investors
very, very anxious.

29
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,401
I had to promise to conduct a
very thorough, on-site inspection.

30
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,629
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

31
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:34,382
I need to or they'll
pull the funding.

32
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,316
That'll slow him down even more.

33
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,893
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

34
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:43,300
Watch your head.

35
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,030
If two experts sign
off on the island,

36
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,790
the insurance
guys will back off.

37
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:52,118
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

38
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,946
-They want Alan Grant.
-Grant?

39
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,118
You'll never get
him out of Montana.

40
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,124
Why not?

41
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,963
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

42
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,381
Why not?

43
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,804
Because Grant's like me.

44
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,205
He's a digger.

45
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,512
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

46
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,578
I hate computers.

47
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,358
The feeling's mutual.

48
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,540
Take a look.

49
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,669
Did it work?

50
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,246
How long does this take?

51
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,831
Should bring an
immediate return.

52
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,382
You shoot the
radar into the ground,

53
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,006
and the bone bounces
the image back.

54
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,171
Bounces it back...

55
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,305
This new program IS incredible.

56
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,347
A few more years' development, and
we won't even have to dig anymore.

57
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,148
Where's the fun in that?

58
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,228
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.

59
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,448
Post-mortem contraction of
the posterior neck ligaments.

60
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,108
Velociraptor?

61
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,738
Yes. Good shape, too.

62
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,239
It's five, six feet high. I'm
guessing nine feet long.

63
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,664
Look... What'd you do?

64
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,082
He touched it.

65
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,251
Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.

66
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,124
Hell, they've got it in for me.

67
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,707
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.

68
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,463
It's no wonder these
guys learned how to fly.

69
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,679
No, seriously.

70
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,604
Maybe dinosaurs have more In common
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

71
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,182
Look at the pubic bone,
turned backward, just like a bird.

72
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,565
Look at the vertebrae, full of
air sacs and hollows, like a bird.

73
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,777
And even the word
"Raptor" means "bird of prey."

74
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,154
That doesn't look very scary.

75
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,446
More like a 6-foot turkey.

76
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,291
A turkey?

77
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,125
Imagine yourself in
the Cretaceous period.

78
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,422
Here we go.

79
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,673
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

80
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,968
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

81
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,473
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity IS based on movement,

82
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,304
like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.

83
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,515
But no, not Velociraptor.

84
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,936
You stare at him and
he just stares right back.

85
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,109
And that's when
the attack comes.

86
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,282
Not from the front,
but from the side.

87
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,703
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

88
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,203
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

89
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,910
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

90
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,417
and he is out in force today.

91
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,920
And he slashes at you with this,

92
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,513
a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

93
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,638
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.

94
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,852
He slashes at you

95
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,521
here or here...

96
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,977
Alan.

97
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,315
Or maybe across the
belly, spilling your intestines.

98
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,568
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

99
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,576
So, you know, try to
show a little respect.

100
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,494
Okay.

101
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,504
Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

102
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,677
you could've
pulled a gun on him.

103
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,256
Yeah, I know. Kids.

104
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,091
You want to have one of those?

105
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,885
I don't want that kid,

106
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,142
but a breed of the
child could be intriguing.

107
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,898
I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?

108
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,400
They're noisy, they're
messy, they're expensive.

109
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,980
Cheap, cheap.

110
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,486
They smell.

111
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,237
They don't smell! Some smell.

112
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,615
Give me a break! Babies smell.

113
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,250
Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!

114
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,580
Tell them to shut down!

115
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,914
Cut the machine!

116
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,591
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

117
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,014
Just cut it, will
you? Shut it down!

118
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,845
What?

119
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,659
What the hell do you
think you're doing in here?

120
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,865
We were saving that.

121
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,864
For today, I guarantee it.

122
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,288
Who in God's name
do you think you are?

123
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,460
John Hammond.

124
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,915
And I'm delighted to meet
you finally in person, Dr. Grant.

125
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,971
So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.

126
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,888
Who's the jerk?

127
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,091
This is our paleobotanist, Dr...

128
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,391
Sattler.

129
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,769
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

130
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,227
I'm sorry about the dramatic
entrance, Dr. Sattler, but...

131
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,308
Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.

132
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,816
Will you have a drink? We
won't let it get warm. Sit down.

133
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,653
Let me have this. I'll just
get a glass or two. I can do it.

134
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,279
There's samples all over here.

135
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,986
I know my way
around the kitchen.

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,242
Now, I'll get
right to the point.

137
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,166
I like you. Both of you.

138
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,830
I can tell instantly
about people. It's a gift.

139
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,085
I own an island off
the coast of Costa Rica.

140
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,176
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years,

141
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,759
I've been setting up
a biological preserve.

142
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,220
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

143
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,773
Make the one I've got down
in Kenya look like a petting zoo.

144
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,023
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

145
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,603
And what are those?

146
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,484
Small versions of adults, honey.

147
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,486
And not just kids, everyone.

148
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,911
We're going to open next year,
If the lawyers don't kill me first.

149
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,489
I don't care for
lawyers, do you?

150
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,916
I don't really know any.
Don't really know any.

151
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:57,089
I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.

152
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,175
Says that they insist
on outside opinions.

153
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,877
What kind of opinions?

154
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,005
Well, your kind, not to
put too fine a point on it.

155
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,184
Let's face it, In your particular
fields, you're the top minds.

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,727
And if I could just persuade you

157
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,353
to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,

158
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,858
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

159
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,406
Why would they
care what we think?

160
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,075
What kind of park is this?

161
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,329
It's right up your alley.

162
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,411
Why don't you come down, just
the pair of you, for the weekend?

163
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,668
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

164
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,667
I've got a jet standing
by at Choteau.

165
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,970
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

166
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,424
We just dug up a new skeleton...

167
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,603
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

168
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,689
This is a very unusual
time. The timing is...

169
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,149
...for a further three years.

170
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,613
Where's the plane?

171
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,109
Okay. Three years.

172
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,489
Cheers.

173
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,033
Dodgson!

174
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,000
You shouldn't use my name.

175
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,842
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

176
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,671
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

177
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,099
What're you trying to
look like, a secret agent?

178
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,926
Well? $750,000.

179
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,933
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

180
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,104
That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.

181
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,275
I'll get them all.

182
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,271
Remember, viable embryos. They're
no use to us if they don't survive.

183
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,614
How am I supposed
to transport them?

184
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,120
The bottom screws open.

185
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,452
That's great. Oh, my God.

186
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,035
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

187
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,665
You guys. That's great.

188
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,396
Customs can even
check it if they want to.

189
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,956
Let me see. Go on.

190
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,675
There's enough
coolant for 36 hours.

191
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,923
No menthol?

192
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,051
The embryos have to be
back here in San José by then.

193
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,882
That's up to your
guy on the boat.

194
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,640
7:00 tomorrow night on the East
Dock. Make sure he gets it right.

195
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,721
How are you planning
to beat security?

196
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,932
I've got an 18-minute window.

197
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,978
Eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

198
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,109
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

199
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,655
That was Hammond's mistake.

200
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,338
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

201
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,763
Well... We try to.

202
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,693
You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.

203
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,609
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

204
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,189
especially for a mathematician.

205
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,150
Chaotician.
Chaotician, actually.

206
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,030
John doesn't subscribe to chaos,

207
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,613
particularly what it says
about his science project.

208
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,416
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

209
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,369
Because of the behavior of
the system in phase space?

210
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,707
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...

211
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,048
Don't.

212
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,215
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant, you've
heard of Chaos Theory?

213
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,513
No.

214
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,884
No? Non-linear equations?

215
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,715
Strange attractors?

216
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,473
I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.

217
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,859
I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.

218
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,410
There it is.

219
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,481
Bad wind shears. We
have to drop pretty fast.

220
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,026
Hold on, this will be thrilling.

221
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,469
But you need that piece
over here, and that piece...

222
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,309
We'll have landed by
the time you get it right.

223
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,519
Great.

224
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,468
The full 50 miles of
perimeter fence are in place?

225
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,771
And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.

226
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,062
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

227
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,228
Let's get this straight. This
is not a weekend excursion.

228
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,402
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

229
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,366
Your investors, whom I
represent, are deeply concerned.

230
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,946
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

231
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,789
I'll shut you down, John.

232
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,411
In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.

233
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,218
All right, slow
down. Slow. Stop!

234
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,096
This shouldn't be here.

235
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,745
Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct

236
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,577
since the Cretaceous
Period. I mean, this thing...

237
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,002
What?

238
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,946
Look at that.

239
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,322
It's a dinosaur.

240
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,005
You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.

241
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,006
We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

242
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,428
They're wrong. This is a
warm-blooded creature.

243
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,005
This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.

244
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,216
This thing's got a
25, 27-foot neck?

245
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,722
The Brachiosaurus? 30.

246
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,847
Thirty feet.

247
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,030
We're gonna make a
fortune with this place.

248
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,369
How fast are they?

249
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,715
Well, we clocked the
T-Rex at 32 miles an hour.

250
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,917
T-Rex?

251
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,012
You said you've got a T-Rex?

252
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,173
Say again.

253
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,717
We have a T-Rex.

254
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,767
Put your head
between your knees.

255
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,439
Dr. Grant,

256
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,858
my dear Dr. Sattler,

257
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,446
welcome to Jurassic Park.

258
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,838
They're moving in herds.

259
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,683
They do move in herds.

260
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,359
How did you do this?

261
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,487
I'll show you.

262
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,632
Good day.

263
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,052
The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

264
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,934
incorporating all the
latest technologies.

265
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,313
And I'm not talking just about
rides. Everybody has rides.

266
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,647
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding

267
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,317
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

268
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,489
So, what are you thinking?

269
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,079
That we're out of a job.

270
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,827
Don't you mean "extinct"?

271
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,553
Why don't you all sit
down? Donald, sit down.

272
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:51,536
Why don't you all sit
down? Donald, sit down.

273
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,718
Here he comes.
Well, here I come.

274
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,602
Hello.

275
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,763
Say hello.

276
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,019
Hello.

277
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,355
Hello, John.

278
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,815
Yes, I've got lines.

279
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,365
Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?

280
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,362
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

281
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,197
Your blood.

282
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,531
Right.

283
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,367
That hurt.

284
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,879
Relax, John. It's all part
of the miracle of cloning.

285
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,048
Hello, John.

286
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,293
Cloned from what?

287
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,096
Loy extractions never
recreated an intact DNA strand.

288
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,261
Not without massive
sequence gaps.

289
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,259
Paleo-DNA, from what source?

290
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,396
Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?

291
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,401
What? What?

292
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,113
Well, Mr. DNA, where
did you come from?

293
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,569
From your blood.

294
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,949
Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA,

295
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,576
the building blocks of life.

296
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,957
A DNA strand like me is a
blueprint for building a living thing.

297
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,300
And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,

298
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:17,639
left their blueprints behind for us to
find. We just had to know where to look.

299
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:22,644
A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.

300
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,105
And just like today, they
fed on the blood of animals.

301
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,943
Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,

302
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,774
mosquitoes would land on the
branch of a tree and get stuck in the sap.

303
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,988
After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilized,

304
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:45,993
just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.

305
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,296
This fossilised tree
sap, which we call amber,

306
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,876
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside

307
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,046
until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.

308
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,090
Using sophisticated techniques,

309
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,267
they extract the preserved blood

310
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:07,688
from the mosquito,
and bingo: dino DNA!

311
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:13,023
A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

312
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,740
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,

313
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,990
it'd take two years to look
at the entire DNA strand.

314
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,746
It's that long. Since it's
so old, it's full of holes.

315
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,039
Now that's where our
geneticists take over.

316
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,207
Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers

317
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,463
break down the
strand in minutes.

318
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,590
And virtual-reality displays

319
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,843
show our geneticists the
gaps in the DNA sequence.

320
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,926
We used the
complete DNA of a frog

321
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,934
to fill in the holes and
complete the code.

322
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,689
Whew! And now, we
can make a baby dinosaur.

323
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,776
This score IS only temporary.

324
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,904
It all has very dramatic
music, of course.

325
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,074
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

326
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,072
And then, the tour moves on.

327
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,341
Well, look here. Those hard-working
cowpokes you see behind us...

328
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,797
This is overwhelming, John.

329
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,139
Are these characters
autoerotica?

330
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,891
No, we have no
animatronics here.

331
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,357
Those people are the real
miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

332
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,652
...in unfertilized
emu or ostrich eggs.

333
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,405
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

334
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,982
Can't we see the
unfertilized eggs?

335
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,192
Shortly.

336
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,243
Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...

337
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,539
Can't you stop these things?

338
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,708
I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

339
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,752
One, two, three.

340
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,547
-You can't do that.
-What?

341
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,090
Can they do that?

342
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,796
The boat for the mainland

343
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,007
will be leaving at 1900.

344
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:11,016
All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.

345
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,522
Good day, Henry.

346
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,940
Good day, sir.

347
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,581
It's turning the eggs.

348
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,290
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd
hatch before I had to go to the boat.

349
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,841
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

350
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,967
I insist on being here
when they're born.

351
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,091
Come on.

352
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,306
Come on, little one.

353
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,018
Come on, then.

354
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,198
Very good. Push.

355
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,323
-Very good.
-God.

356
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,825
Push. Come on.

357
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,329
Come on. Come on, then.

358
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,461
There you are.

359
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,879
They imprint on the first
creature they come in contact with.

360
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,886
That's it. Helps
them to trust me.

361
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:34,521
I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.

362
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,816
Surely not the ones that
have bred in the wild?

363
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,227
Actually they can't
breed in the wild.

364
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,154
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

365
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,199
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

366
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,615
How do you know
they can't breed?

367
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,200
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

368
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,661
We've engineered them that way.

369
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,374
There you are.

370
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,417
Oh, my God. Look at that.

371
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,133
Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.

372
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,338
Wu?

373
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,719
Ninety-one.

374
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,925
Homoeothermic? It
holds that temperature?

375
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,101
Yes.

376
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,601
But, again, how do you
know they're all female?

377
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,780
What, does somebody go out In the
park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

378
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,325
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

379
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,994
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.

380
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,744
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage

381
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,949
to make them male.

382
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,500
We simply deny them that.

383
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,918
Deny them that?

384
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,706
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

385
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,758
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

386
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,552
it's that life will
not be contained.

387
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,300
Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories

388
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,975
and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

389
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,770
but there it is.

390
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,772
There it is.

391
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,275
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

392
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,780
No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.

393
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,870
What species is this?

394
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,538
It's a Velociraptor.

395
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,209
You bred Raptors?

396
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:48,112
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

397
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,278
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
What are they doing?

398
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,246
Feeding them.

399
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:08,258
Alejandro's prepared a delightful
menu for us. Chilean sea bass, I believe.

400
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,800
Shall we?

401
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,793
They should all be destroyed.

402
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,880
Robert Muldoon. My
game warden from Kenya.

403
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,974
Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.

404
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,971
What's their growth rate?

405
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,679
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

406
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,266
I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...

407
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,351
Fast for a biped? Cheetah speed.

408
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,483
Fifty, sixty miles per hour If
they ever got out in the open.

409
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,315
And they're astonishing jumpers.

410
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,697
Yes. That's why we're
taking extreme precautions.

411
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,489
Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...

412
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,290
They show extreme intelligence.

413
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,834
Even problem-solving
intelligence.

414
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,503
Especially the big one.

415
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,001
We bred eight originally,
but when she came In,

416
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,504
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.

417
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:39,223
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

418
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,767
That's why we have
to feed them like this.

419
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,854
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

420
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,773
The fences are
electrified, right?

421
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,022
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

422
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,776
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses, systematically.

423
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,733
They remember.

424
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,797
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

425
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,170
More adventurous
guests, of course,

426
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,877
can opt for our
jungle river cruise

427
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,383
or for a close-up
look at our majestic...

428
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,716
None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open

429
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,145
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line

430
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,604
six or twelve months after that.

431
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,898
Absolutely spectacular designs.

432
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,191
Spared no expense.

433
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,235
And we can charge
anything we want.

434
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,063
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a
day, and people will pay it.

435
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,818
And there's the merchandise...

436
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,990
Donald.

437
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,737
This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.

438
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,823
Everyone in the world has
the right to enjoy these animals.

439
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:50,499
Sure. They will. We'll have
a coupon day or something.

440
00:34:55,427 --> 00:35:00,297
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

441
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,763
Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.

442
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,264
I know. They're a lot worse.

443
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,597
Now, wait a second, we
haven't even seen the park yet...

444
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,606
Donald, let him talk. There's no
reason, I want to hear every viewpoint.

445
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,941
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

446
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,618
Genetic power's the most
awesome force the planet's ever seen

447
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,537
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

448
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,781
It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...

449
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,162
If I may.

450
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,954
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

451
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,040
It didn't require any
discipline to attain it.

452
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,677
You read what others had
done, and you took the next step.

453
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,096
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

454
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,221
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

455
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,474
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

456
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,804
something as fast as you could.

457
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,146
Before you even knew what you
had, you patented it, and packaged it

458
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,319
and slapped it on a plastic
lunch box, now you're selling it.

459
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,147
You're going to sell it.

460
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,908
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

461
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,407
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

462
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,741
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

463
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,075
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

464
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,084
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

465
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,043
If I was to create a flock
of condors on this island,

466
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,672
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

467
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,505
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

468
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,762
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

469
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,730
Dinosaurs had their shot and
nature selected them for extinction.

470
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,944
I don't understand this Luddite
attitude. Especially from a scientist.

471
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:43,942
How can we stand in the
light of discovery and not act?

472
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,488
What's so great about discovery?

473
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,694
It's a violent, penetrative act,

474
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,407
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

475
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,202
I call the rape of
the natural world.

476
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,878
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

477
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,131
And therefore, how could you
ever assume that you can control it?

478
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,221
You have poisonous
plants in this building.

479
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,827
You picked them
because they look good.

480
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,936
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

481
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,184
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

482
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,394
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here

483
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,354
who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...

484
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:29,035
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

485
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:34,329
I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

486
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,580
two species separated by
65 million years of evolution

487
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,132
have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

488
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,633
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?

489
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,931
I don't believe it.

490
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,306
You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters

491
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,060
and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

492
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,853
Thank you.

493
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,028
They're here.

494
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,824
You four are gonna have a
spot of company out in the park.

495
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,702
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

496
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,370
Grandpa! Kids!

497
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,041
Wait! Careful with me.

498
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,132
We missed you.

499
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,378
Me, too.

500
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,968
We loved the presents.
They were great.

501
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,214
Did you enjoy the helicopter?

502
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,925
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

503
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,391
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

504
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,937
Aren't they lovely? Aren't
they glorious, though?

505
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,527
These will be your
transports for the afternoon.

506
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,648
No drivers?

507
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,650
No. No drivers.
They're electric.

508
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,483
They run on this track In the
middle of the roadway here.

509
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,660
Totally non-polluting. Top of
the line. Spared no expense.

510
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,488
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

511
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,416
You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

512
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,583
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

513
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,580
Dr. Grant, come
in the second car.

514
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,253
I'm gonna ride with Dr. Sattler.

515
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,475
I read your book.

516
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,273
That's great.

517
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:27,442
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

518
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,275
A few species may have
evolved along those lines.

519
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,124
Because they sure
don't look like birds to me.

520
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,794
I heard that there
was this meteor,

521
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:47,174
hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.

522
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,213
Listen...

523
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,419
Tim.

524
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,676
Tim, which car were
you planning on?

525
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,262
Whichever one you are.

526
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,859
Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

527
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,773
It made diamond dust and
that changed the weather.

528
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,400
They died because
of the weather.

529
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,825
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

530
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,122
She said I should ride with
you 'cause it'd be good for you.

531
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,207
The boat is now loading.

532
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:26,001
Everyone must be on the
dock for the 1900 departure.

533
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,341
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm

534
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,711
about 75 miles west of us.

535
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,300
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

536
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,180
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe
it'll swing south like the last one.

537
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,481
Ray, start the tour program.

538
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,868
Hold onto your butts.

539
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,164
And why did they put
the fiberglass thing?

540
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,545
I know.

541
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,223
You want to join
the future, right?

542
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,725
God help us when the
hands of engineers...

543
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,143
During your tour,

544
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,690
the appropriate
information will be

545
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,064
automatically selected
and displayed for you.

546
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,196
Look!

547
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,238
Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.

548
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,565
Are we gonna hit that?

549
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,742
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

550
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,241
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

551
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,511
The voice you're now
hearing is Richard Kiley.

552
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,175
We spared no expense.

553
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,601
If you look to the right,

554
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,603
you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

555
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,684
Dilophosaurus!

556
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,859
Shit!

557
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,778
One of the earliest carnivores,

558
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,199
we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous

559
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:22,280
Spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,

560
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,456
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.

561
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,791
This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition

562
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,796
to Jurassic Park.

563
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,463
Alan?

564
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,720
Where?

565
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,767
Damn.

566
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,732
Vehicle headlights are
on and not responding.

567
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,314
Those shouldn't be
running off of car batteries.

568
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,987
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

569
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,237
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo

570
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,323
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

571
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,995
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?

572
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,167
I am totally
unappreciated in my time.

573
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,091
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

574
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,175
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

575
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,056
You know anybody who
can network eight machines

576
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,935
and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

577
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,440
Sorry about your financial problems, I
really am. But they are your problems.

578
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,363
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

579
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,693
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.

580
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,948
I really will not.

581
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,075
There's been hardly
any debate at all.

582
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,032
I don't blame people
for their mistakes.

583
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,876
But I do ask that
they pay for them.

584
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,336
Thanks, Dad.

585
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,626
The headlights.

586
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,299
I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

587
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,627
It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.

588
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,921
We'll lose part of the system.

589
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:04,966
There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

590
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,141
Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...

591
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,684
Quiet, all of you!

592
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,056
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

593
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,613
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

594
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,869
God creates man. Man destroys
God. Man creates dinosaurs.

595
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,624
Dinosaurs eat man.

596
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,127
Woman inherits the earth.

597
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,976
We'll try to tempt the Rex
now. Keep watching the fence.

598
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,320
What's going to
happen to the goat?

599
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,160
He's going to eat the goat?

600
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,741
Excellent.

601
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,075
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

602
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,957
I happen to be a vegetarian.

603
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,514
T-Rex doesn't want to
be fed. He wants to hunt.

604
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:15,179
You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

605
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:42,043
Eventually you do plan to have
dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

606
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,052
Hello. Yes?

607
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,630
I really hate that man.

608
00:46:55,855 --> 00:47:00,645
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

609
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,897
The essence of chaos.

610
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,062
I'm still not clear on chaos.

611
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,656
It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.

612
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,162
The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.

613
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,490
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking

614
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,668
and in Central Park you
get rain instead of sunshine.

615
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,748
Was I going too
fast? I missed it.

616
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:25,999
I did a fly-by.

617
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,835
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

618
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,670
We should be still.
The car's bouncing.

619
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,597
That's okay. It's
just an example.

620
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,092
Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

621
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,597
A drop of water
falls on your hand.

622
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,430
Which way will the drop
roll off? Which finger?

623
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,189
Thumb, I'd say.

624
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,941
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

625
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,944
I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.

626
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,445
Which way, now?

627
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,535
Let's say back the same way.

628
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,283
It changed. Why?

629
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,747
Because tiny variations,

630
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,708
the orientation of the
hairs on your hands...

631
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,130
Alan, look at this.

632
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,881
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

633
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,506
"Imperfections in the skin"?

634
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,883
...just microscopic,

635
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,886
never repeat and
vastly affect the outcome.

636
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,091
That's what?

637
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,301
Unpredictability.

638
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,311
There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.

639
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,817
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant would
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

640
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,403
And there's another example.

641
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,327
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

642
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,664
Stop the program.

643
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,045
I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

644
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,753
Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.

645
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,134
We're on. Will
notify for resume.

646
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,600
I'll switch it over
to TelePrompTer.

647
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,177
What about the
circuit integrities?

648
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,354
Screen says faulty sensor.

649
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:06,774
I'll call security.

650
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,193
We're at full go on
that and it looks good.

651
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,981
Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker

652
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,316
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.

653
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,617
Where are we going?

654
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,411
He didn't say they
turned into birds.

655
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,704
Anyone else think we
shouldn't be out here?

656
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,954
And his book was a lot
fatter than yours. Like this.

657
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,786
Really? Yours
was fully illustrated.

658
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,171
You okay?

659
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,667
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

660
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,218
Come on. Watch this.

661
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,755
Whoa.

662
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,513
Everybody stay here.

663
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,905
Wow.

664
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,747
Okay?

665
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,912
Of course.

666
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,826
Don't be scared.
Come on, it's okay.

667
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,662
Muldoon tranquillized
her for me.

668
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,087
She's sick.

669
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,389
Oh, my God.

670
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,444
Hey, baby.

671
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,449
She was always my
favorite when I was a kid

672
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,911
and now I see she's the
most beautiful thing I ever saw.

673
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,624
It's okay.

674
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,300
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

675
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,641
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

676
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,971
Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.

677
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,310
It seems to happen
every six weeks or so.

678
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,766
Six weeks.

679
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,998
These are dilated. They are?

680
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,867
Take a look.

681
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,076
I'll be damned.

682
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:34,331
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

683
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,881
Is this West Indian lilac?

684
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,889
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

685
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,025
Are you sure?

686
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,146
Pretty sure.

687
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,896
There's only one
way to be positive.

688
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,112
I'd have to see the
dinosaur's droppings.

689
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,405
Dino droppings? Droppings?

690
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,453
Yeah, I got that.

691
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,792
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

692
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,385
We're gonna have
to cut the tour short.

693
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,258
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

694
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,635
Are you sure we have to?

695
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,591
It's not worth
taking the chance.

696
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,925
Sustained winds at 45 knots.

697
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,307
Tell them when they
get back in the cars.

698
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:35,062
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

699
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,484
Drop what you're
doing and leave now.

700
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,901
Damn!

701
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,493
That is one big pile of shit.

702
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,458
You're right. There's
no trace of lilac berries.

703
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,589
That's so odd, though.

704
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,673
All right, she's suffering
from Melia toxicity

705
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,681
every six weeks.

706
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,852
Let's see, rats.

707
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,982
She's tenacious.

708
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,613
You have no idea.

709
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,570
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

710
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,757
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

711
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,766
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

712
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,306
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

713
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,139
I'll drop her off at the center
before I make the boat.

714
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,941
Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.

715
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,142
You sure?

716
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,979
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

717
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,484
Okay, then.

718
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:23,587
There's nothing I can do. The
captain says we got to go, we got to go.

719
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,384
You've got to give me the time.

720
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,930
I did a test run, it took me 20
minutes. I think I can push it to 18

721
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,348
but you've got to give
me at least 15 minutes.

722
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,766
No promises.

723
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,235
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

724
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:50,452
So much for our first tour. Two
no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

725
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,579
It could've been worse.

726
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,032
A lot worse.

727
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,295
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

728
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,542
I thought maybe I'd get
somebody something.

729
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:06,376
I've had only sweets and
I'm gonna get something salty.

730
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,633
I finished debugging the phones.

731
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,806
I was going to, so I did.

732
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,052
So I debugged the
phones. And I thought maybe

733
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,896
I should tell you the
system will be compiling

734
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,891
for 18 to 20 minutes, so
some of the minor systems,

735
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,899
they might go on and off for a
while, but it's nothing to worry about.

736
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,506
Do you got any kids?

737
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,509
Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.

738
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,676
Anything at all can
and does happen.

739
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,679
Same with wives,
for that matter.

740
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,313
You're married?

741
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,561
Occasionally.

742
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,980
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

743
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,789
Five, four, three,

744
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,794
two, one.

745
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,385
-That's odd.
-What?

746
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,058
Door security systems
are shutting down.

747
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,392
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

748
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,657
By the way, Dr. Sattler,

749
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,785
she's not available, is she?

750
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,961
Why?

751
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm sorry. You two are...

752
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,130
Yeah.

753
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,468
What'd I touch?

754
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,799
You didn't touch
anything. We stopped.

755
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,393
What the hell?

756
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,488
What now?

757
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,483
Fences are failing
all over the park.

758
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,070
Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.

759
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,017
Just look at this work station.

760
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,351
What a complete slob.

761
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,733
The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

762
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,407
No, no. They're still on.

763
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,580
Why the hell would he
turn the other ones off?

764
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,329
Access main program.

765
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,832
Access main security.

766
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,672
Access main program grid.

767
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,516
You didn't say the magic word.

768
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,475
Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

769
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,020
Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.

770
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,815
Phones are out, too.

771
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,279
Where did the vehicles stop?

772
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,889
Their radio's out, too.

773
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,558
Gennaro said to
stay put. Kids okay?

774
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,761
I didn't ask. Why
wouldn't they be?

775
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,558
Kids get scared. What's scary?

776
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,809
It's just a little hiccup in
the power. I'm not scared.

777
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,062
I didn't say you were scared.

778
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,372
I know.

779
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,320
Boo!

780
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,907
Hey, where did you find those?

781
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,363
In the box, under my seat.

782
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,739
Are they heavy?

783
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,617
Yeah. Then they're
expensive. Put them back.

784
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,422
Don't scare me.

785
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,764
Cool. Night vision.

786
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,666
Did you feel that?

787
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,283
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

788
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,165
What is that?

789
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,471
Where's the goat?

790
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:21,995
Jesus!

791
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,464
He left us.

792
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,478
Where does he think he's going?

793
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,276
When you got to
go, you got to go.

794
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,708
Dr. Grant.

795
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,719
I hate being right all the time.

796
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,945
Keep absolutely still. Its
vision is based on movement.

797
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,923
Turn the light off.

798
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,296
Turn the light off!

799
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,611
Hurry! Turn it off!

800
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,029
I'm sorry!

801
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,194
You're the one who turned it...

802
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,323
Ian, freeze!

803
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,283
Get the kids!

804
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,205
Get rid of the flare!

805
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,529
Get the kids!

806
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,124
Get rid of the flare!

807
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,619
Hail Mary, full of grace...

808
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,476
No!

809
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,648
Dr. Grant!

810
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,826
I'm stuck. The
seat's got my feet.

811
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,199
I'll get you next. You're okay.

812
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,994
You're all right.

813
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,326
Tim!

814
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,920
Don't move. He can't
see us if we don't move.

815
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,407
Lex, you're choking me.

816
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,486
Grab the wire.

817
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:52,135
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

818
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:55,434
He's turning the safety systems
off. Doesn't want anybody to see.

819
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,813
Look at this next entry. It's
the kicker. "White rabbit object.”

820
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,152
It did it all. With
the keychecks off,

821
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,855
the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.

822
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:06,692
The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.

823
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,368
How many lines
of code are there?

824
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,944
About two million.

825
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,696
Two million? Yeah.

826
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:19,292
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you
would be good enough to take a gas jeep

827
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,124
and bring back my grandchildren.

828
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,172
Sure.

829
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,464
I'm going with him.

830
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:33,973
John.

831
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,528
I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.

832
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,067
Should have been there by now.

833
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,673
Damn it!

834
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,761
There's the road!

835
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:23,352
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to that thing there.

836
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,859
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

837
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,621
My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!

838
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,158
You've got time. You can
do it. Do it. Come on, Dennis.

839
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,790
Hello.

840
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,545
Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.

841
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,102
Nice boy.

842
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,807
Nice dinosaur.

843
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,065
Thought you were one of your
big brothers. You're not so bad.

844
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:52,069
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

845
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,652
I'm soaking wet. I don't have
any food. I have nothing on me.

846
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,452
Go on. Play fetch?

847
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,625
Look, stick.

848
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,459
Look at stick.

849
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:10,296
Stick, stupid. Fetch the
stick, boy. Look at the stick.

850
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,135
You like the stick?
Go on and get it.

851
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,138
No wonder you're extinct.

852
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,054
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

853
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,678
Timmy!

854
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,805
Now, Lex. Listen.

855
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,182
Lex, I'm right here.

856
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,348
I'll look after you. I
have to help your brother.

857
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,649
Stay right here and wait for me.

858
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,360
He left us.

859
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:56,356
But that's not what
I'm going to do.

860
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,572
Okay?

861
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,154
Stay here.

862
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,312
You hear me? I'm coming up.

863
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,988
I hate climbing. I hate
trees, way too high.

864
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,350
You okay?

865
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,596
I threw up.

866
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:14,942
That's okay.

867
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,612
Just give me your hand.

868
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,825
Tim, I won't tell anyone you
threw up. Just give me your hand.

869
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,372
Here, I've got you.

870
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,171
Okay.

871
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,178
That's good. Over the rail.

872
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,425
Don't pull me too hard.

873
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,219
Stand on the door.
Hang on to me.

874
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,567
That's not too bad,
right, Timmy? Yes, it is.

875
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,362
It's like a tree house. Your
dad ever build you one?

876
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,984
Yeah, me, too.

877
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,448
The thing about climbing
is, you never |look down.

878
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,120
This is impossible.

879
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,974
How am I going to
do this? It's about...

880
01:17:08,998 --> 01:17:12,081
I'm going to help
you with your footing.

881
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,871
Oh, no.

882
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,710
Tim, go.

883
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,529
Go, Tim, go!

884
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,039
Faster, Tim!

885
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,872
Tim, jump!

886
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:04,969
Go, Tim.

887
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,851
We're back in the car again.

888
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,150
At least you're out of the tree.

889
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,992
Where's the other car?

890
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,575
Alan!

891
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,948
Dr. Grant!

892
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,137
I think this was Gennaro.

893
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,514
I think this was, too.

894
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:58,107
I think it's ahead of us.

895
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,648
It could be anywhere.

896
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,944
With fences down, it can wander
in and out of any paddock it likes.

897
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,111
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

898
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:16,540
Remind me to thank
John for a lovely weekend.

899
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,289
Can we chance moving him?

900
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,091
Please chance it.

901
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,227
Ellie, come on!

902
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,019
It's the other car!

903
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,854
Dr. Grant?

904
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,860
They're not here.

905
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,724
Anybody hear that?

906
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,735
It's an impact
tremor, is what it is.

907
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,403
I'm fairly alarmed here.

908
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:37,580
Come on. We've got to get
out of here. Now! Right now!

909
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,456
Let's go.

910
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,215
Must go faster.

911
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,725
Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!

912
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,809
Get off the stick! Bloody move!

913
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,189
Look out!

914
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,638
Think they'll have
that on the tour?

915
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,399
Are you hearing this?

916
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,153
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

917
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,827
Let's get up this tree.

918
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,533
Come on, Tim, it's
okay. Listen. Try up here.

919
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,619
Oh, man.

920
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,212
I hate trees.

921
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,089
They don't bother me.

922
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,383
Yeah? Well, you
weren't in the last one.

923
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,564
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

924
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,526
They're singing.

925
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,599
Don't let the monsters
come over here.

926
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,102
They're not monsters, they're
animals. These are herbivores.

927
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:12,727
They only eat vegetables. For
you, I think they'd make an exception.

928
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,482
I hate the other kind.

929
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,363
They just do what they do.

930
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:40,679
What's that?

931
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,855
What are you and Ellie going to do
now, if you don't dig up bones anymore?

932
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,516
I don't know.

933
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,191
I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.

934
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,075
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

935
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,288
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

936
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,082
"Do-you-think-he-saurus."

937
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,289
What do you call a
blind dinosaur's dog?

938
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,464
You got me.

939
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,717
A "Do-you-think -he-saurus rex."

940
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,216
Alan?

941
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,468
Yeah?

942
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,305
What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?

943
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,810
I'll stay awake. All night?

944
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:35,559
All night.

945
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,445
They were all melting.

946
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:34,286
Malcolm's okay for now. I
gave him a shot of morphine.

947
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,711
They'll be fine.

948
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,008
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

949
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,219
You know, the first

950
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:55,981
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland

951
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,145
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

952
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:03,317
Really quite wonderful.

953
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,152
I had a wee trapeze and a

954
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,580
carousel

955
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,915
and a seesaw.

956
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,255
They all move
motorized, of course.

957
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,254
People said they saw the
fleas. "I can see the fleas.

958
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,094
"Can't you see the fleas?"

959
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:30,178
Clown fleas, high-wire
fleas, and fleas on parade.

960
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,856
With this place,

961
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:43,358
I wanted to show them
something that wasn't an illusion.

962
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:47,449
Something that was real.
Something that they could

963
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,078
see and touch.

964
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,253
An aim not devoid of merit.

965
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,378
But you can't think through this
one, John. You have to feel it.

966
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,306
You're absolutely right.

967
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,477
Hiring Nedry was a
mistake, that's obvious.

968
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,226
We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.

969
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:20,978
Next time,
everything's correctable.

970
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:24,987
Creation is an
act of sheer will.

971
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,282
Next time, it'll be flawless.

972
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,162
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

973
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,821
When we have control...

974
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,578
You've never had
control! That's the illusion.

975
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,415
I was overwhelmed by
the power of this place.

976
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,251
I made a mistake, too.

977
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:47,175
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

978
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,969
The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.

979
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,261
Alan and Lex and Tim.

980
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:02,020
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

981
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,205
It's good.

982
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,630
Spared no expense.

983
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:53,994
Go away!

984
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,161
It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

985
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,494
It's a "Veggie-saurus",
Lex. "Veggie-saurus."

986
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:01,249
Veggie.

987
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,911
Come on. Come on, girl.

988
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,541
Come on, baby.

989
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,425
Go.

990
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,424
I'm not letting go.

991
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,526
It looks like it has a cold.

992
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,231
Yeah. Maybe.

993
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,233
Can I touch it? Sure.

994
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,616
Just think of it as
kind of a big cow.

995
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,199
I like cows.

996
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,594
Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

997
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,308
God bless you.

998
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,644
Yuck. Great.

999
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,696
Now she'll never
try anything new.

1000
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,150
She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.

1001
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:17,286
I'm a hacker.

1002
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:19,036
That's what I
said. You're a nerd.

1003
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,654
I am not a computer nerd.

1004
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,365
I prefer to be called a hacker.

1005
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,832
God.

1006
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,334
You know what this is?

1007
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,209
It's a dinosaur egg.

1008
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:38,180
The dinosaurs are breeding.

1009
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:45,392
But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

1010
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:49,023
Amphibian DNA. What's that?

1011
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,857
Well, on the tour,

1012
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:57,863
the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

1013
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,370
They mutated the
dinosaur genetic code

1014
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,661
and blended it
with that of frogs.

1015
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:12,005
Some West African frogs have been
known to change sex from male to female

1016
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,174
in a single sex environment.

1017
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,544
Malcolm was right.

1018
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,260
Look.

1019
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,607
Life found a way.

1020
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,529
No. That's crazy.
You're out of your mind.

1021
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,572
He's absolutely out of his mind.

1022
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,405
Wait. What exactly
would this mean?

1023
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,528
We're talking about
a calculated risk,

1024
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,363
which is the only
option left to us.

1025
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:48,917
We'll never find the command Nedry
used. He's covered his tracks far too well.

1026
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:52,254
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

1027
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,840
So, shutting down
the entire system...

1028
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,883
Get somebody
else. I won't do it.

1029
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:01,965
Shutting down the system is the
only way to wipe out everything he did.

1030
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:06,886
Now, as I understand it, all
the systems will then come back

1031
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,771
on their original
start-up mode. Correct?

1032
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,271
Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.

1033
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:14,609
It may not come back on.

1034
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,357
Would we get the phones back?

1035
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,109
Yes, again, in theory.

1036
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,574
What about the
lysine contingency?

1037
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,116
We could put that into effect.

1038
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,245
What's that?

1039
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,029
That's absolutely
out of the question.

1040
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,956
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals,

1041
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,916
if they ever get off the island.

1042
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:33,667
Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1043
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,665
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

1044
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,510
Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1045
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,096
People are dying.

1046
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,644
Will you please shut
down the system?

1047
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:13,330
Hold on to your butts.

1048
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:34,306
It's okay.

1049
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,104
Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.

1050
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,981
What do you mean it
worked? Everything's off.

1051
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:43,691
Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

1052
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:46,197
Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:

1053
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,655
telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

1054
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,831
System's ready.
Where are the breakers?

1055
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,955
Maintenance shed at
the end of the compound.

1056
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,787
Three minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.

1057
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,964
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker

1058
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,385
until Mr. Arnold returns, and
the whole system's running again.

1059
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:03,964
I'm tired. I'm dirty.

1060
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:05,133
I'm tired. I'm dirty.

1061
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,588
I'm hot.

1062
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:10,551
Looking at the map, I'd say
the visitor's center is just a mile

1063
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,517
over that rise
there. Just keep...

1064
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:18,892
What is that?

1065
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,404
Tim, can you tell
me what they are?

1066
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,115
They are

1067
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,696
Gallimimus.

1068
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,283
Are those meat-eating?

1069
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,331
"Meat-asauruses"?

1070
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,676
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

1071
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,424
Just like a flock of
birds evading a predator.

1072
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,096
They're flocking this way.

1073
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,063
I want to go now.

1074
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,228
Just look how it eats.

1075
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:38,601
Please.

1076
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,475
I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.

1077
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,651
Yes. Go now.

1078
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,152
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

1079
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,319
Look how much blood.

1080
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,664
God. Something went wrong.

1081
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:01,123
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

1082
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,423
This is just a delay.

1083
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,593
That's all it is. All major
theme parks have delays.

1084
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:13,181
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.

1085
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,933
If the Pirates of the
Caribbean breaks down,

1086
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,260
the pirates don't eat tourists.

1087
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:20,814
I can't wait any more.
Something's wrong.

1088
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,265
I'm gonna go get
the power back on.

1089
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,645
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?

1090
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:29,110
Don't let's be too hasty. I
mean, it's only been gone...

1091
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,823
I'm going with you. Okay.

1092
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,676
Sorry.

1093
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,727
Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.

1094
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:02,230
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

1095
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:07,902
Right.

1096
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,902
But it ought to be
me, really, going.

1097
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:17,039
Why?

1098
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,913
I'm a... And you're a...

1099
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,663
Look. Come on, let's go.

1100
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:25,997
We can discuss sexism in
survival situations when I get back.

1101
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,754
You just take me through this
step by step. I'm on Channel 2.

1102
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:30,879
Right.

1103
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,464
The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.

1104
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,798
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

1105
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:20,717
Come on, this way.

1106
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:30,401
I can see the shed from here.

1107
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,320
We can make it if we run.

1108
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:35,240
No. We can't.

1109
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,446
Why not?

1110
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:39,865
Because we're being hunted.

1111
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,198
In the bushes, straight ahead.

1112
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,168
It's all right.

1113
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,124
Like hell it is.

1114
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,629
Run. Towards the shed.

1115
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,303
I've got her.

1116
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,714
Go. Now!

1117
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,322
Mr. Arnold?

1118
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:26,874
John, I'm in.

1119
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:28,709
Great.

1120
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:33,499
Ahead of you is a metal
staircase. Go down it.

1121
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:36,839
Okay. Going down.

1122
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:41,465
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

1123
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:42,799
Have her follow the main cable.

1124
01:39:42,823 --> 01:39:44,734
I know how to read a schematic.

1125
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:17,258
I guess that means
the power's off.

1126
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:31,848
That's not funny.

1127
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:33,104
That was great.

1128
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,570
Well, maybe we, we could...

1129
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,916
Damn it. Dead end.

1130
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,508
Wait a minute.

1131
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:04,340
There should have been a
right turn back there somewhere.

1132
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,925
Look above you.

1133
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:11,646
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.

1134
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:12,935
Follow that.

1135
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,771
Okay. Following the piping.

1136
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:22,862
I bet I could climb over to the other
side before you could even get to the top.

1137
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,234
What would you give me?

1138
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,363
Respect.

1139
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,326
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1140
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,207
I see the box.

1141
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:35,996
It says, "High Voltage." Yeah.

1142
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,212
Okay.

1143
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:46,843
Good. Here we go.

1144
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,679
Over the top.

1145
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,969
Take your time.

1146
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:53,517
Good. Come on.

1147
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,648
Find your footing.

1148
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:00,570
You can't throw the
main switch by hand.

1149
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:04,066
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

1150
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:06,533
It's large, flat, and gray.

1151
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,196
All right, here I go. Okay?

1152
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:15,877
One, two, three, four.

1153
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,921
Okay, charged.

1154
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:22,417
Under the words "Contact
Position," there's a round green button

1155
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,052
which says "Push to Close."

1156
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,430
Push to close.

1157
01:42:30,936 --> 01:42:32,222
Push it.

1158
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:51,120
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1159
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,285
Switch them on.

1160
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:05,804
Get down now!

1161
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,003
You're gonna have to jump.

1162
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,930
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1163
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,256
Do what Dr. Grant says!

1164
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:11,637
Let go. I'll count to three.

1165
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:14,136
One, two, three!

1166
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:17,473
Four. Five.

1167
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,982
I'm coming up to get you.

1168
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,601
I've got to get Tim.

1169
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,440
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1170
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:27,531
One,

1171
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:30,367
two...

1172
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,955
He's not breathing.

1173
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:50,300
I think we're back in business!

1174
01:43:58,524 --> 01:43:59,980
No!

1175
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,314
Clever girl.

1176
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:56,927
No, Tim!

1177
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,598
Good boy.

1178
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:07,357
Three.

1179
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:13,614
Hello?

1180
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:27,207
Okay. I'm gonna
have to find the others.

1181
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:31,041
Get you to a doctor.

1182
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:35,382
Lex, you look after Tim. Yeah.

1183
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:38,639
Your hair is all sticking up.

1184
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,931
Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.

1185
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,396
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1186
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:17,837
Run.

1187
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,252
Just the two Raptors, right?

1188
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,627
You sure the third
one's contained?

1189
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:43,306
Yes, unless they figure
out how to open doors.

1190
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:11,750
What is it?

1191
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,202
It's a Velociraptor.

1192
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,373
It's inside.

1193
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:44,032
Follow me.

1194
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:20,848
It's in there.

1195
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:22,975
Control room.

1196
01:52:29,388 --> 01:52:30,469
We can call for help?

1197
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,826
We've got to reboot
the system first.

1198
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,056
The door locks!

1199
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:40,038
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1200
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:51,053
No, boot up the door locks!

1201
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,278
Get back! Boot
up the door locks.

1202
01:52:54,303 --> 01:52:56,044
You can't hold it by yourself!

1203
01:53:04,694 --> 01:53:07,854
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1204
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,697
It's all the files
of the whole park.

1205
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,530
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1206
01:53:15,087 --> 01:53:16,669
Try to reach the gun.

1207
01:53:25,147 --> 01:53:27,104
I can't get it unless I move.

1208
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:44,979
This is it. This
might be the right file.

1209
01:54:01,077 --> 01:54:02,458
-You got it!
-Yes!

1210
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:09,021
Yes! Yes!

1211
01:54:09,252 --> 01:54:10,353
This is it!

1212
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:14,281
What works?

1213
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:17,486
All security systems
are enabled. We got it.

1214
01:54:27,288 --> 01:54:28,494
Grant.

1215
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:31,618
Mr. Hammond, the
phones are working.

1216
01:54:31,727 --> 01:54:33,108
The children all right?

1217
01:54:33,455 --> 01:54:34,786
The children are fine.

1218
01:54:35,124 --> 01:54:38,958
Call the mainland. Tell them
to send the damn helicopters.

1219
01:54:39,414 --> 01:54:41,576
It's gonna cut
through the glass!

1220
01:55:33,301 --> 01:55:34,462
Move!

1221
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:22,552
Tim, let go. Yeah!

1222
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:44,217
After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.

1223
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,386
So have I.

1224
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:35,017
Come on.
